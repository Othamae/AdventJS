# Challenge #11: ðŸ“– The studious elves


In Santa's workshop, the elves love puzzles ðŸ§ . This year, they have created a special one: a challenge to form a Christmas palindrome.

<span style="color:yellow">**A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards**</span>. The elves want to know if it is possible to form a palindrome by making, at most, one exchange of letters.

Create a function getIndexsForPalindrome that receives a string and returns:

- <span style="color:yellow">**If it is already a palindrome, an empty array.**</span>
- <span style="color:yellow">**If it is not possible, null.**</span>
- <span style="color:yellow">**If a palindrome can be formed with one change, an array with the two positions (indexes) that must be swapped to create it.**</span>

For example:
```JavaScript
getIndexsForPalindrome('anna') // []
getIndexsForPalindrome('abab') // [0, 1]
getIndexsForPalindrome('abac') // null
getIndexsForPalindrome('aaaaaaaa') // []
getIndexsForPalindrome('aaababa') // [1, 3]
getIndexsForPalindrome('caababa') // null
```

If the palindrome can be formed with different swaps, <span style="color:yellow">**always return the first one found.**</span>
