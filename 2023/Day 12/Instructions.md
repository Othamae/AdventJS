# Challenge #12: ðŸ“¸ Is it a valid copy?

At the North Pole, <span style="color:yellow">**they still use paper photocopiers**</span>. The elves use them to copy the letters that children send to Santa so they can send them to all the gift departments.

However, <span style="color:yellow">**they are very old and donâ€™t work very well**</span>. Every time they make a copy, the quality of the copy slightly decreases, a phenomenon known as generational loss.

<span style="color:yellow">**You need to detect if one letter is a copy of another**</span>. The letters are very long and you canâ€™t read them, but you can compare them with an algorithm.

Thereâ€™s a big <span style="color:yellow">**probability**</span> that a character would degrade in each copy (it doesn't always happen!). And when it does, the rule it follows is:

- <span style="color:yellow">**The characters from A to Z degrade from uppercase to lowercase (A-Z â‡’ a-z)**</span>
- <span style="color:yellow">**Letters degrade in a series of characters in this order: a-z â‡’ # â‡’ + â‡’ : â‡’ . â‡’**</span>
- <span style="color:yellow">**Once the letters have degraded into the symbols, they can continue to degrade.**</span>
- <span style="color:yellow">**Note that the last one is a blank space, not an empty character.**</span>
- <span style="color:yellow">**Characters that are not letters (like digits) do not degrade.**</span>

Knowing this and receiving the original letter and the copy, you must determine if the copy is a copy of the original.

```JavaScript
checkIsValidCopy(
  'Santa Claus is coming',
  'sa#ta cl#us is comin#'
) // true
checkIsValidCopy(
  'Santa Claus is coming',
  'p#nt: cla#s #s c+min#'
) // false (for the initial p)
checkIsValidCopy('Santa Claus', 's#+:. c:. s') // true
checkIsValidCopy('Santa Claus', 's#+:.#c:. s') // false (there is a # where it should not be)
```
To understand how photocopies work and their degradation, look at this example:

```JavaScript
original:  'Santa Claus'
1st copy:  'santa cla#s'
2nd copy:  'sa#t# cl#+s'
3rd copy:  'sa+## c#+:s'
4th copy:  's#++. c+:.s'
5th copy:  's#+:. c:. s'
```
Therefore ``s#+:. c+:++`` is a valid copy of ``Santa Claus``. And, as you can see, the degradation of the letters does not occur in a specific order, it is random.
